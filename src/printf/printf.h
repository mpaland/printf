 *
 * @brief Small stand-alone implementation of the printf family of functions
 * (`(v)printf`, `(v)s(n)printf` etc., geared towards use on embedded systems with
 * a very limited resources.
 *
 * @note the implementations are thread-safe; re-entrant; use no functions from
 * the standard library; and do not dynamically allocate any memory.

/**
 * Prints/send a single character to some opaque output entity
 *
 * @note This function is not implemented by the library, only declared; you must provide an
 * implementation if you wish to use the @ref printf / @ref vprintf function (and possibly
 * for linking against the library, if your toolchain does not support discarding unused functions)
 *
 * @note The output could be as simple as a wrapper for the `write()` system call on a Unix-like
 * system, or even libc's @ref putchar , for replicating actual functionality of libc's @ref printf
 * function; but on an embedded system it may involve interaction with a special output device,
 * like a UART, etc.
 *
 * @note in libc's @ref putchar, the parameter type is an int; this was intended to support the
 * representation of either a proper character or EOF in a variable - but this is really not
 * meaningful to pass into @ref putchar and is discouraged today. See further discussion in:
 * @link https://stackoverflow.com/q/17452847/1593077
